The Cross-Validation tool compares the performance of one or more Alteryx-generated predictive models using the process of [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)). Among predictive modelers, cross-validation is frequently preferred over other model evaluation methods because it does not require the use of a separate test set, and it generates more robust estimates of model quality. This tool supports all classification and regression models.

For all classification models, the tool provides the overall accuracy, the accuracy by class, and a set of confusion matrices (one for each model). Additionally, the tool reports the F1 score and a collection of Performance Diagnostic Plots (lift curve, gain chart, precision vs recall curves and ROC curve) for binary classification models. For regression models, the tool generally provides the correlation between predicted and actual values, the [root mean square error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) (RMSE), the [mean absolute error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error) (MAE), the [mean percentage error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_percentage_error) (MPE), and the [mean absolute percentage error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) (MAPE) of each model's predictions. But when at least one target value is near 0, the MPE and the MAPE are undefined. So in this case, the MPE is replaced with the sum of the errors over the sum of the actual values, and the sum of the absolute errors divided by the sum of the actual values (ie the Weighted Absolute Percentage Error) replaces the MAPE. Additionally, the tool always provides a plot of actual vs predicted values in the regression case.

This tool is not automatically installed with Alteryx Designer. To use this tool, download it from the [Alteryx Analytics Gallery](https://gallery.alteryx.com/).
